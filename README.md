# torutils
Few tools to derive the status of a Tor relay.
The script *info.py* gives an overview about all used ports whilst *ps.py* shows all used _exit_ ports with a 1-second refresh.

## typical call
    $> ./info.py
    $> ./ps.py

## more info
Have a look at https://www.zwiebeltoralf.de/torserver too.
